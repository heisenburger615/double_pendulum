# double_pendulum
Simulation of a physical double pendulum using vpython

The initial values are set to mass of 1 kg for both bobs and 2 meters for both rods. There are also initial values set for theta1 and theta2. These values can be changed to either stabilize the system or make it more chaotic. A graph is included in the diagram which plots the position of the second bob as the simulation runs. One could add another two lines of code if they wished to also graph the position of the first bob.
